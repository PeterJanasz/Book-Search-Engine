## Description

Book Search Engine is a site where users can search for any book title or author. The user is than able to save books to their saved books page and manage their saved books list by deleting books they no longer need saved. TTo accomplish this, I implemented a GraphQL API into a fully functioning book engine that was built using the MERN stack, replacing the previous RESTful API.

## Features

1. User authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
2. Search for books using the googlebooks api
3. Save books for reference later and ablitiy to delete saved books using Graphql and MongoDB.
   
## Installation

Download the repository and install the dependencies using `npm install` <br/>
Run the code using `npm develop` 

## Usage
This is the front-end webpage of the Book-Search-Engine. It is responsive, adapting to multiple screen sizes. The main page shows new users a menu, with which they can search for books, login, or signup. If the user is logged in, the buttons they will see options to search for books, view their saved books, delete saved books, and/or logout.
